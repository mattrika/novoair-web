    <p class="mb-4">
        Families traveling with young children using a baby buggy or passengers using a wheelchair
        for mobility, who are capable of using each without assistance, should be allowed to use the
        buggy or wheelchair to the departure gate.

        <span class="font-semibold text-blue-700 underline">Please Note:</span> Baby buggies where
        it is not possible to stow it in the cabin, it will be necessary to stow them in the hold of

        MUSICAL <span class="text-blue-800">INSTRUMENTS</span>

        Make sure the instruments are properly packed. Attach a Fragile Label. Tag the instruments
        with a Limited Release Tag. Normal excess charges apply.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Very often passengers want their valuable musical instruments with them in the cabin. Larger
        instruments (more than 115cm) can only be accepted in the cabin on an extra seat which must
        be paid for.

        FRAGILE BAGGAGES

    <p class="mb-4">
        NOVOAIR accepts no liability for fragile baggage with fragile contents. The passenger must
        be informed before accepting such fragile items.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Baggage must be packed in such a way that it can withstand normal handling. Items that,
        because of their nature, could cause damage to other passenger's baggage (e.g. broken
        bottles can spill liquid) may not be accepted for check-in.

        PORTABLE <span class="text-blue-800">DIALYSIS MACHINE</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
        In addition to the normal free baggage allowance, a passenger dependent on a portable
        dialysis or "kidney" machine, is entitled to carry a machine and ancillary equipment.
        Because of the size (50 x 50 x 40 cms), the machine must be stowed in the hold, using the
        bulk hold where possible on wide bodied aircraft.

        Cremated Human Remains are accepted for carriage as Checked Baggage provided:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
            The passenger is in the possession of all necessary documentation including a

        <li>
            The casket or urn containing the cremated remains is packed in a sealed outer box or

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Cremated Human Remains are not acceptable for carriage in the passenger cabin due to
        unsuitability of these items for security inspection prior to boarding.
